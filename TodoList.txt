Done
Intake subsystem should be completely done, besides finding a good speed to run the intake at
Index subsystem should be completely done, with the full suite of commands, but again, find good speeds
Pivot should be done logic-wise, with instant positions, changable positions, and manual power. Manual pivot command should also work
Shooter should have all of the necessary stuff, but idk if the array of PID controllers is a great idea,
    I just don't know how to control all of them together, without making them follow each other, because I can't do
    that due to needing to eject. I'll just have to test and see
Intake/Index combination commands should work

To do
Intake - 
 - Find good speeds
Index - 
 - Find good speed
Pivot - 
 - Find positions & error values
 - PID tuning
Shooter - 
 - See if my way of doing things works
 - Get regression based on position
Climb - 
 - Everything
Limelight implementation - 
 - Everything

Combination commands - 
 - 
Auto shooting - 
 - Everything
Swerve - 
 - PID tuning


Find speeds for all subsystems

How the robot should work - 
Intake - 
Since the pivot needs to be in the correct position, intake should be a toggle that moves the arm up and down to the correct spot
Eject just spins the intake motor backwards, doesn't do anything else
On intaking, index motor runs until note reaches the break beam or command is cancelled

Index motor cannot spin when breakbeam is broken unless shoot motor is at the correct speed

Normal pivot runs on PID control, with 2 set points controlled with buttons. 1 for trap and 1 for amp. The left joystick is
also used to manually adjust shooter

There is a button to turn on shooters, and another to activate auto aim
Another button to actually feed the note to the shooter IF it is at the proper speed

The button for trap position raises the climb

Buttons - 
X -> raise pivot to intake -> start intake -> run index until note breaks beam
    X -> cancel
Hold circle -> Spin intake backwards while held
Square -> Toggle shooter
Triangle -> Toggle Shooter + Auto aim

R1 feed note

povUp -> toggle shooter to trap mode -> pivot to trap -> raise climb
    rAxis -> control climber
    hold square -> shooter on + feed index
povRight -> pivot to amp
    hold square -> shooter on + feed index

lAxis -> manual pivot adjust
