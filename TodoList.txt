Done
 - Intake

How the robot should work - 
Intake - 
Since the pivot needs to be in the correct position, intake should be a toggle that moves the arm up and down to the correct spot
Eject just spins the intake motor backwards, doesn't do anything else
On intaking, index motor runs until note reaches the break beam or command is cancelled

Index motor cannot spin when breakbeam is broken unless shoot motor is at the correct speed

Normal pivot runs on PID control, with 2 set points controlled with buttons. 1 for trap and 1 for amp. The left joystick is
also used to manually adjust shooter

There is a button to turn on shooters, and another to activate auto aim
Another button to actually feed the note to the shooter IF it is at the proper speed

The button for trap position raises the climb

    X -> cancel
